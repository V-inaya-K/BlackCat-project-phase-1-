<label><h1>CUPCAKES & CASHMERE</h1>

<!--textarea start for 1st blog-->  
<textarea id="main" name="content-1"  style="height:200px;width: 1220px;margin-left: 1cm;;margin-right: 1cm;" maxlength="600">What It Is: A lifestyle and fashion blog by Emily Schuman, full of all sorts of great posts on everything from fashion/beauty, to decor, to recipes, to work, to reflections on life with her husband and young daughter.

Why I Love It: I had always heard people talk about this blog, but didn’t start following regularly until a year or two ago.  I’ll be the first to admit that fashion-ish blogs aren’t usually my thing, but I feel like Emily is really down-to-earth, and posts about trendy things in a fun and helpful and accessible way.  Her beauty tutorials are also always fascinating and spot-on.  More than anything though (I’m realizing a theme here…), I love the posts when she shares about her husband, and all of the honest ups and downs of navigating life as a new mom.
       
Recommendations: All of her beauty tutorials/recommendations.  Her personal posts.  Her DIY projects.</textarea>

<label><h1>A CUP OF JO</h1>
  <h4>@Joanna Goddard(Jan 13, 2020)</h4></label>
<textarea id="main" name="content-1"  style="height:200px;width: 1220px;margin-left: 1cm;;margin-right: 1cm;" maxlength="600">What It Is: A lifestyle blog by Joanna Goddard, full of random lists, questions, product recommendations, and regular posts on everything from style, to food, design, travel, relationships and motherhood.
  
Why I Love It: This is another long-time read for me, and one that I still completely look forward to tuning into daily.  Her posts are always interesting and fun, and I look forward to her list of links every weekend.  Also of note — she has really awesome readers, so the comment sections on her posts are usually just as fascinating to read as well.
  
Recommendations: Her regular “Have A Lovely Weekend” posts.  Her “Motherhood Around The World” series (fascinating).  All product recommendation lists (see her style and design categories, although heads up that you’ve gotta click fast on the links — her readers regularly buy out the items she loves).  Everything on relationships and motherhood.</textarea>

<label><h1>ADVICE FROM A TWENTY SOMETHING</h1>
  <h4>@Amanda Holstein(Mar 30,2019) </h4></label>
<textarea id="main" name="content-1"  style="height:200px;width: 1220px;margin-left: 1cm;;margin-right: 1cm;" maxlength="600">What It Is: A lifestyle blog by Amanda Holstein (who actually also writes now for The Everygirl), full of “advice for the modern girl” on everything from fashion to beauty, decor, relationships, blogging and more.
  
Why I Love It: Don’t be turned away by the title if you’re not a 20-something.  I recently discovered this blog, and have really been enjoying it in my thirties.  ;)  She has really cute style, and posts all sorts of genuinely helpful tutorials on all things stylish (from hair tutorials to skincare/makeup tips to fashion advice and more).  But then she also has some great blogging and career posts, as well as her trademark relationship advice posts.

Recommendations: Her skincare archives.  Everything in the real life archives.  Lots of really great styling advice.</textarea>
